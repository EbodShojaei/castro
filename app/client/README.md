AI agent address: ```0x2085411d270c8D5d3640f9E2643F2DAd3Ed2E32d``` as of 2025-01-25. I could rotate it, but why bother unless someone really tries to hack it. The agent is hosted on a private server, so good luck with that and make sure to let me know how it goes :D

A regular user could never guess the wallet address without observing the server logs that the agent is hosted on. Talk about security through obscurity :D

Now you know. Chat responsibly ;D
